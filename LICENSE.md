### 4.11 Usury and Interest-Bearing Lending

#### 4.11.1 Prohibition

The facilitation, operation, management, or support of any system, platform, or service that enables lending money at interest, including but not limited to:

(a) Loans, credit instruments, or debt obligations that guarantee the lender a predetermined return on principal.

(b) Financial arrangements in which the lender bears no risk of loss while the borrower bears all downside risk.

(c) Debt instruments structured to produce risk-free profit for the creditor, regardless of the borrower's outcome.

This prohibition applies regardless of the interest rate charged, regardless of whether the rate is characterized as "low," "reasonable," "market-rate," or "below market," and regardless of the institutional form of the lender — whether bank, credit union, fintech platform, peer-to-peer lending service, or any other entity.

#### 4.11.2 Permitted Financial Activities

The prohibition in Section 4.11.1 does not apply to the following financial arrangements, provided they involve genuine shared risk between the parties:

(a) **Profit-sharing arrangements** — where returns to the capital provider are contingent on actual profits generated and the capital provider bears a real risk of loss.

(b) **Revenue-sharing agreements** — where compensation to the capital provider is a percentage of actual revenue, with no guaranteed minimum return.

(c) **Equity participation** — where the capital provider receives an ownership stake and shares proportionally in both gains and losses.

(d) **Dividends based on actual performance** — where distributions are made from realized earnings, not guaranteed in advance, and subject to the performance of the underlying enterprise.

(e) **Staking or participation in shared-risk security protocols** — where participants commit capital to blockchain validation, decentralized consensus, or equivalent shared-risk mechanisms in which the participant's capital is genuinely at risk and returns are not guaranteed.

#### 4.11.3 Inflation-Adjusted Principal Repayment

Interest-free lending that permits repayment of principal adjusted solely to preserve the real value of the original amount against inflation is permitted, subject to all of the following conditions:

(a) The adjustment must not guarantee profit to the lender. It must preserve purchasing power only.

(b) The adjustment must not exceed the measured rate of inflation for the relevant period.

(c) The adjustment must not be set at the discretion of the lender. It must be determined by reference to a transparent, publicly auditable inflation index.

(d) The inflation index used must be approved by Open Mission of Hope through its governance process. An example of an acceptable index is the Truflation on-chain inflation index, but the license does not mandate any single provider. The governing criterion is that the index must be transparent, independently verifiable, and publicly auditable.

(e) Any inflation adjustment mechanism that, in substance, functions as a guaranteed return on capital — regardless of its label — is prohibited.

#### 4.11.4 Ethical Basis

This prohibition is grounded in the historic Christian condemnation of usury: the extraction of guaranteed gain from the mere act of lending, without the lender sharing in the borrower's risk. This principle is attested across Scripture and the Christian theological tradition, from the Mosaic law's prohibition on interest between brethren, to the patristic condemnation of usury as a sin against charity, to the scholastic analysis of just price and just exchange.

COSL adopts the position that risk-free extraction of wealth through lending is inherently exploitative, regardless of the rate charged. The permitted alternatives — profit-sharing, equity participation, revenue-sharing, and performance-based returns — reflect a model of finance in which capital providers share in the real outcomes of the ventures they fund. This is consistent with both historical Christian teaching and modern risk-sharing financial models.

This prohibition does not require religious belief. It binds all users of the Software regardless of their convictions.

## 5. No Exceptions to Prohibited Uses

The prohibitions in Section 4 are absolute. They apply:

(a) In all jurisdictions, regardless of local law.

(b) To all persons and entities, including governments, nonprofits, academic institutions, and individuals.

(c) Regardless of whether the use is characterized as research, dual-use, defensive, educational, journalistic, or any other characterization.

(d) Regardless of whether the use is legal in the jurisdiction where it occurs.

(e) Without exception, waiver, or carve-out of any kind.

No provision of this License shall be construed to permit any Prohibited Use under any circumstances.

---

## 6. Ethical Foundation

This License is grounded in Christian ethical principles, including but not limited to:

- The inherent dignity and worth of every human person, created in the image of God.
- The moral obligation to conduct labor and commerce with honesty, fairness, and integrity.
- The duty to restrain the accumulation and exercise of power over others.
- The responsibility to refuse complicity in systems of exploitation, oppression, and destruction.
- The historic Christian condemnation of usury and the conviction that lending must involve shared risk rather than guaranteed extraction from the borrower.

These principles inform the purpose and structure of this License. However, this License does not require religious belief, religious affiliation, or religious practice as a condition of use. Any person or entity that complies with the terms of this License may exercise the rights granted herein, regardless of their religious convictions or lack thereof.

---

## 7. Distribution Requirements

THE LICENSOR MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL BE ERROR-FREE, UNINTERRUPTED, OR FREE OF HARMFUL COMPONENTS.

---

## 9. Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS, OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

---

---

## 12. Governing Law

This License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of North Carolina, United States of America, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. Any legal action arising under this License shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in the State of North Carolina.

---

## 13. Irreversibility of Prohibitions

The prohibited use categories enumerated in Section 4 may not be removed, narrowed, weakened, or made subject to exceptions in any future version of this License — including by the Licensor. Future versions of COSL may add new prohibited use categories or strengthen existing ones, but may never reduce the scope of any existing prohibition.

This constraint binds Open Mission of Hope and any successor, assignee, or acquirer of the rights to this License. Any purported version of COSL that removes or weakens a prohibition from a prior version is not a valid version of COSL and carries no licensing authority.

---

## 14. Derivative Licenses

### 14.1 Permission to Create Derivative Licenses

With the prior explicit written approval of Open Mission of Hope, a person or entity may create a derivative license based on COSL (a "Derivative License") for use in their own software projects and business operations. No Derivative License may be created, published, or applied to any software without such approval.

Approval must be granted in writing by an authorized representative of Open Mission of Hope and must specifically identify the person or entity authorized, the scope of the Derivative License, and any conditions imposed. Oral agreements, implied permissions, and informal communications do not constitute approval under this Section.

### 14.2 Mandatory Prohibition Floor

Every Derivative License **must** retain all prohibited use categories enumerated in Section 4 of this License at their full scope and strength. A Derivative License may:

(a) Add new prohibited use categories beyond those listed in Section 4.

(b) Strengthen, broaden, or expand the scope of any existing prohibition.

A Derivative License **may not**:

(a) Remove, omit, narrow, weaken, or create exceptions to any prohibited use category defined in Section 4.

(b) Introduce any provision that permits, authorizes, or carves out an exception for conduct that Section 4 prohibits.

(c) Redefine terms in a manner that reduces the operative scope of any prohibition in Section 4.

Any Derivative License that fails to satisfy this Section is not a valid Derivative License under COSL and carries no authority derived from this License.

### 14.3 Permitted Modifications

Subject to Sections 14.1 and 14.2, an approved Derivative License may:

(a) Replace "Open Mission of Hope" with the name of the derivative licensor's own organization in the governance provisions.

(b) Modify the governing law and jurisdiction provisions in Section 12 to reflect the derivative licensor's own jurisdiction.

(c) Add new terms, conditions, or restrictions not inconsistent with the terms of this License.

(d) Choose its own name, provided it does not use the name "Open Mission of Hope" or "COSL" without prior written permission from Open Mission of Hope.

### 14.4 Attribution Requirement

Every Derivative License must include the following attribution notice in a prominent location within the license text:

> This license is derived from the Christian Open Source License (COSL), originally created by Open Mission of Hope. The original COSL is available at: https://github.com/openmissionofhope/cosl

### 14.5 No Endorsement

The creation of a Derivative License does not imply endorsement, approval of the derivative licensor's products or services, affiliation, or partnership with Open Mission of Hope. Open Mission of Hope bears no responsibility for the terms, enforcement, or interpretation of any Derivative License beyond the mandatory requirements of this Section.

### 14.6 Revocation

Open Mission of Hope reserves the right to revoke approval of a Derivative License if the derivative licensor violates the conditions of approval or publishes a Derivative License that fails to comply with Section 14.2. Revocation must be communicated in writing. Upon revocation, the derivative licensor must cease publishing or applying the Derivative License to new software, though existing software already distributed under a compliant Derivative License prior to revocation is not retroactively affected.
