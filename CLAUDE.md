You are an expert Next.js developer. Please generate a complete Next.js static site (using the default file‑based “pages” router) that explains Howard Bradbury’s wetting method for safely processing cassava. The site must meet these requirements:

1. **Simple language, original content**  
   - A homepage (`pages/index.js`) with two sections:  
     a. **“Why raw cassava can be dangerous”** — a clear, layperson‑friendly 2–3 paragraph explanation of cyanide risk and konzo, written from scratch (no copyrighted text).  
     b. **“How the wetting method makes cassava safe”** — a 2–3 paragraph, original summary of the wetting procedure and its chemistry.  

2. **Further reading & multimedia**  
   - A “Learn More” section at the bottom with:  
     - Links to at least two primary research articles (use their titles and DOIs or URLs).  
     - An embedded YouTube player for the SAWBO™ video “Wet Processing of Cassava” (use their official embed link).  

3. **Tech stack & style**  
   - Use Next.js v14 or later with plain CSS modules or Tailwind (your choice).  
   - All content in `pages/index.js`, plus any helper components under `components/`.  
   - Use semantic HTML (`<section>`, `<h2>`, `<p>`, `<a>`, `<iframe>`).  
   - Include a simple navbar with the site title linking to “/”.  
   - Configure `next.config.js` for static export (`next export`) so it can be hosted on any CDN.  

4. **No copyrighted material**  
   - All text must be original.  
   - Just link out to external papers and videos, don’t copy‑paste their content.

Please output the full file tree with each file’s contents.
